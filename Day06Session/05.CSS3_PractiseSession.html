            <li>master.css: by default the HTML page will have some spacing, to remove them we will use </li>
            <li>* represents it will be applied to all the HTML elements in the document</li>
            <li>* { padding: 0; margin: 0; } </li>
            <li>which means the browser will start from position (0,0)</li>
            <li>Now view the page in broswer, it will start from (0, 0)</li>
            <li>div is block level element hence occupying full page width</li>

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
