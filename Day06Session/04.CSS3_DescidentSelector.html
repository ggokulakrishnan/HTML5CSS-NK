            <li>Descident is nothing but the child of parent</li>
            <li>(h2) is the Descident of (div) and (em) is Descident of (p)</li>
            <li>here is this a parent and child relation</li>
            <li>if we traverse from parent to child element then we can select the required element and the style 
                will be applied only to that particular element and not to any other element</li>
            <li>In Descident selector one is css class/id and other is HTML element</li>
            <li>Only in group selectors comma will be used, in Descident selector a space will be used</li>
            <li>group selector is applied between two classes where Descident selector is applied within a class/hierarchy</li>
            <li>Now that both the (em) values are set to green in color due to Descident selector</li>
            <li>.primary-box p em { color: seagreen; }</li>
            <li>Now we have a condition where the first primary-box em value should be orange and the second 
                primary-box em value should be greem </li>
            <li>to achieve assign a class name to first (em) </li>
            <li>There is some text (em class="white")in the box</em> </li>
            <li>In css file create a Descident selector as </li>
            <li>.primary-box p .white { color: white; }</li>
