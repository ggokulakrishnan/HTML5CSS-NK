    <p>The teachings of Mahatma Gandhi are <q>ahimsha parmodharma</q></p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Ahimsa_Paramo_Dharma">
        Ahimsa is only loosely translated as non-violence. Unlike the English word 'non-violence' (which is absolute in
        its meaning), ahimsa means non-violence in a relative sense. There are times when violence can also be
        considered ahimsa if that violence is used to stop greater violence. For example, a king should always raise his
        rod of chastisement to keep peace and order in his country. He will fail in the discharge of his duty if he does
        not punish the wicked, and his country will be in a state of utter chaos. To hang a murderer is Ahimsa for a
        king. To kill a man who is taking away the lives of many is Ahimsa. A real Sannyasin, however, should not defend
        himself even when his life is in danger. A Sannyasin is one who doesn't associate with his body, instead
        identifying himself with the Atman. [2].
